# Mythic Metals

Mythic Metals is a Fabric based Minecraft mod, that adds over 30 new axes, swords, hoes, pickaxes, shovels, ores, ingots, and sets of armor. 
The mod is heavily inspired by Shadowclaimers Metallurgy, and was originally intended as a port. After being denied the privilege to do so this mod was created from the ground up as my first proper Minecraft mod.  

This is the master branch. I usually push updates once i intend to create a new release.

You can find the patch notes in the PATCHNOTES.md, on the release page, or on the files themselves on CurseForge.

Currently there are a couple of implementations in the works for Mythic Metals. The first is a mod called Starry Skies, featuring the ores in their dimension. The second one is compatability with Smithee, by LordDeatHunter, which is a tool construction mod. Expect links to them once they are released here, and on CF.
