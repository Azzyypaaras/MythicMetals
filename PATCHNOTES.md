# 0.9.9
### Note!
You will need to download Alloy Forgery in order to use Mythic Metals! Link: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/alloy-forgery

Added new anvils! These can be made from a selection of the metals, and will not break!  
Added new chains! These can be crafted from a selection of metals and nuggets.  
Added a new material: Hallowed. Made from the hallowed ores (adamantite, mythril and orichalcum).  
Unembedded PigLib. You will now have to install it manually, to prevent version issues.  
Added two new libraries: EnchantGiver and Alloy Forgery.    
EnchantGiver lets me add innate enchantments to aquarium and prometheum. They can be overridden with higher enchantments, but will not disappear even if a grindstone is used.  
Alloy Forgery is a new mod that lets you build a multiblock alloy smelter. This smeltery replaces the old alloy system, making alloy smelting require lava and different tiers of smelters (currently only 2 tiers are in place, with nothing more planned).  
Added experimental BYG, Terrestria and Traverse support! You will now find biome specific ores such as Starrite in their biomes.  
Squashed a couple of bugs related to Harvest Scythes and Charm.  
Removed Lutetium, as it only served as a worse silver alternative.  

Adjusted most of the textures, as well as adding some new models. Thank you to:
* DH(LordDeatHunter), for a lot of the re-colours, item models and animated textures.  
* Temreno, for the new armour and tool models.  
* Tector, for the new ore and ingot textures.  
* Pois1x, for the new anvil model + texture.  

Balancing changes:  
* Quicksilver now has a higher mining level, higher dmg and speed, but less durability  
* Carmot has recieved a major buff  
* Quadrillum can now be smelted with a normal furnace  
* Slightly buffed hallowed  
* Made Kyber slightly easier to find  
* Increased Ur spawn rate  
* Buffed Banglum, Discordium, and Durasteel
* Nerfed Prometheum and Kyber  
* Buffed Metallurgium tools & weapons
* Major Stormyx buff  
* Slowsilver armor has been nerfed, as well as small tool nerf  

# 0.9.8  
Added PigLib Integration. If installed Piglins will let you trade with Midas Gold, and ignore you wearing Midas Gold and Argonium armor.  
Added TechReborn Integration, letting you use their machines to possibly automate alloy creation!  
Added Mechanix Integration, letting you double ores through their methods.  
Added Modern Industrialization integration. You can now use the dust mixer for higher alloy yields.  
Updated tag conventions: moved a lot of tags out of the common directory, and added dust tags for mod compat.  
Added hallowed dust, allowing for better automation of metallurgium.  
Changed Durasteel recipe to require Quadrillum instead of Ferrite.  
Speaking of Ferrite, it has been removed. It had a brick-like color and conflicted in purpose with other ores.    
Added Hallowed Dust for mod compatability.

* Minor nerf to Oricalcums mining speed  
* Nerf to Starrite  
* Nerfed Kyber tools
