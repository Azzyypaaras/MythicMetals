# Mythic Metals

Mythic Metals is a Fabric based Minecraft mod, that adds over 35 new axes, swords, hoes, pickaxes, shovels, ores, and ingots. 
The mod is heavily inspired by Shadowclaimers Metallurgy, and was originally intended as a port, however after being denied the privilege to do so, this mod was created from the ground up.
